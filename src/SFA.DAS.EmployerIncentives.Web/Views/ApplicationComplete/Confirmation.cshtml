                You're eligible for the first payment after the apprentice completes 90 days of their apprenticeship training and the second payment after 365 days.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Before we can make a payment, we need your training provider to confirm whether the apprentice is still on their apprenticeship. Training providers usually submit information about their apprentices at the start of every month.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We'll start making payments from January 2021. It will take longer to get your first payment for any apprentices who start their training in August 2020.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We'll use your organisation's bank details to make your payment. You do not need to do anything else.

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Changes to your payment</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Your payment amount may change if an apprentice has their 25th birthday before they start their apprenticeship.
