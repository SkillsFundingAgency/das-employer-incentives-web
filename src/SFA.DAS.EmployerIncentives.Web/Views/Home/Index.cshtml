            <p>The recruit a new apprentice grant is available for employers that take on new apprentices from September 2020. Employers can apply for the grant after they add each apprentice to their apprenticeship service account.</p>

            <p>For apprentices aged:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>We'll pay the grant in 2 equal instalments. You'll receive the first payment after the apprentice completes 90 days of their apprenticeship and the second payment after 365 days.</p>
            <p>We make payments on the 10th of each month. You'll need to give us your organisation's bank details when you apply, so that we can pay you the grant directly.</p>
