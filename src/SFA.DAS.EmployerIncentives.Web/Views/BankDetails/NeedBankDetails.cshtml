                We cannot make any payments until we've received and verified @Model.OrganisationName's bank details. This could take up to 3 months and we may contact someone from @Model.OrganisationName.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                You can add the bank details:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>using the link we've sent to your email address</li>
                <li>in the 'hire a new apprentice payment applications' section of the apprenticeship service account</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">After we've verified your bank details</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We'll make the payment in 2 equal instalments for each apprentice. The first payment is after an apprentice completes 90 days of their apprenticeship and the second is after 365 days. The training provider needs to confirm to ESFA when an apprentice is ready for each payment.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Payments are made by Bacs on the 14th working day of the month. It usually takes 3 working days to process.
            </p>
